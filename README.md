> MyResumeChecker is a full-stack web application designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for specific job applications. Users can upload their resumes and job descriptions, and the app automatically compares the skills and keywords in both to provide an AI-driven match score. In addition to resume analysis, users can create and manage tasks, helping them stay organized throughout their job search. With a modern, intuitive interface built using React and Tailwind, and a powerful Python backend for AI processing, MyResumeChecker streamlines the entire job application process.
